Flashscore is a popular website providing live scores, statistics, and news across various sports. However, it lacks an
official API for developers to access its data. This is where FlashscoreScraping comes in.

This project serves users seeking reliable sports results data. Sports enthusiasts can use the scraper data to
to track their favorite teams, analyze past results, and predict future outcomes. Additionally, researchers,
students, and educators can utilize the data for academic purposes.
